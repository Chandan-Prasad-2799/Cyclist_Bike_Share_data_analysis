# Cyclist_Bike_Share_data_analysis
Analysis of how casual riders differ from members to maximize their memberships and provide digital media adds.
The dataset to this project has been obtained from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html here, we have used data from Jan 2019- Dec 2019.
In the initial steps, the required R packages are loaded and installed 
The dataset consists of 4 datasets having data of same type but different names. The data sets are modified according to a consistent column name and data type.
For more better understanding, the data sets are combined and analysis is done on that data
The deeper analysis involves splitting up of data od date into week days and months.
The average of ride_length( duration of ride length) is calculated by taking an appropriate guage against week_day. 
The output of the results is seen in the file.
